### Hi there! 👋🏻

I'm <u>**Chelsea**</u>, a second-year uni student in Sydney, Australia.

I'm currently studying a Bachelor of Information Technology, majoring in Web and App Development, and I'm interested in **front-end web development**.

I'm still learning a lot of web-related languages at the moment and looking forward to becoming a front-end developer.

Outside of my studies, I'm interested in making music and tattooing as hobbies.
