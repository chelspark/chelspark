### Hi there! 👋🏻

I'm <u>**Chelsea**</u>, a third-year uni student in Sydney, Australia.

currently studying a Bachelor of Information Technology and primarily interested in **full-stack web/app development**.

Outside of my studies, I'm really into making music(house, tech, afro, r&b, indie). I also play minecraft and league of legends every now and then.
